# Multilevel-Cache-Simulator
A Command-Line Multi-Level Cache Simulator in C++

`Multilevel Cache Simulator` is a powerful multi-level cache simulator written in C++. This project provides a comprehensive and efficient platform to simulate L1 and L2 caches and analyze their performance. With a command-line interface, `Multilevel Cache Simulator` offers flexibility and ease of use for researchers, students, and enthusiasts exploring cache behavior and memory performance.

## Key Features:
* Simulate L1 and L2 cache hierarchies with customizable parameters.
* Evaluate cache hit rates, miss rates, and memory access latencies.
* Analyze the impact of cache size, associativity, replacement policies, and write policies.
* Supports various cache replacement policies such as LRU, FIFO, and random.
* Command-line interface for easy integration into scripts and automation.
* Generate detailed reports and statistics for in-depth analysis.
* Efficient and optimized codebase for fast simulations.
* Portable and cross-platform compatibility.
* `Multilevel Cache Simulator` empowers users to gain insights into cache performance by simulating L1 and
